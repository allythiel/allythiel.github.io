Portfolio Project

In this project, the technologies that were used include HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

The portfolio project was introduced to get familiar with using styling in the form of HTML and CSS, while also using Bootstrap to assist with many components, before diving into React.js and being able to combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS. This project was created to be utilized as a portfolio after graduating from the 16 week immersive full stack development bootcamp with devCodeCamp.
