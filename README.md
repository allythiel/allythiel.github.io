# Portfolio Project

In this project, the technologies that were used include:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

The portfolio project was introduced to get familiar with using styling in the form of HTML and CSS, while also using Bootstrap to assist with many components. This project allowed me to get my basic understanding of styling before diving deep into React.js, where I would combine the languages of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This project was created to be a way to showcase the many projects that were completed during the 16 week immersive Software Development Bootcamp with devCodeCamp.
